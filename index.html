    <h1>BuyMyBeard's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>
        Hey, I'm <b>Alexandre "BuyMyBeard" Lacombe</b>, and I make games!
    </p>
    <img src="img/profile.jpg">
    <p>
        I am currently in my final semester of programming and development training at Collège Lionel-Groulx, 
        and I am soon to graduate!
    </p> 
    <p>
        In addition to my studies, I pursue programming as a hobby, participating in various game jams and undertaking 
        side projects. Notably, I achieved <b>1<sup>st</sup> place</b> in Gamedev.js 2023's open-source category and was
        <a href="https://github.blog/2023-06-21-gamedev-js-2023/">featured on The GitHub Blog</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently seeking employment opportunities in gameplay programming within the Montréal region. 
        Additionally, I am self-teaching various tech-art disciplines with the aim of becoming a Tech Artist in the future!
